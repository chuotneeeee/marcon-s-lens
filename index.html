    <h1> Marcon </h1>
    <p> I am an extrovert and I know that not only the introverted but the extroverted also have to face lots of psychological problems. We like sharing our thoughts with others; however, not everyone can listen to us attentively. Sometimes, we feel sharing too much can reveal our weaknesses but keeping everything inside also makes the extroverted irritated. We are scared of others knowing too much about our feelings. Since the appearance of the Covid pandemic, we have been unable to release energies and counteract the stress due to abundant energies inside them. We know that it is better to meet others in order to regenerate our energy. I used to wish I were an introvert. I won't lie to you. I read many articles about how wonderful the introverted was and the successful introverted leaders. I found a multitude of the extrovert’s weaknesses. As a result, I hated being an extrovert given that I have dyed to be a good leader. Moreover, I thought that introverts who were more mysterious would be cooler and more attractive.On the way to explore myself,  I know that I have to solve that psychological problem on my own. I have learned about the signs of my spirit and I listen to myself attentively first. Then I seek some help from communication. I need them to help me renew my energy. I  continue sharing because I realize that only a small group of people thought about my sharing. They can do nothing to me but I can help someone or myself through my sharing. I also realize that leading skills don’t relate to these factors and can be improved over the period. Finally, I am still an extrovert, continuing to share and listening to myself attentively. I pride myself on my ability to make sense of my soul. Don’t be scared to be an extravert and turn into an introvert if it’s not yourself. Finding solutions by your own methods. Both extroverts and introverts are worthy! </p>
